I'm Ben.  I've been a software developer for a while.  I've worked on things like:
- 12-lead electrocardiographs [Work, NDA]
- Enterprise-grade non-volatile storage devices [Work, NDA]
- Embedded audio/video HW-accelerated encoding/decoding devices [Work, NDA]
- Validation process, tool design, and architecture [Work, NDA]
- Audio/video transmissions systems [Work, NDA]
- Linux drivers [Mostly work, NDA]
- Keyboard development [Hobby]

I've done almost nothing with external git repos; looking to change that.

But enough about me.  You're here, looking at my profile.  What's interesting in your world?  :)
